🌍 International Student Club Website

This project is a fictional website developed for a university assignment. It represents an online platform for the International Student Club at Asia Pacific University (APU), aiming to support international students through cultural exchange, event promotion, and community engagement.

📘 Introduction

In recent years, the number of international students at Asia Pacific University (APU) has grown rapidly, creating a diverse and multicultural learning environment. However, many foreign students still face challenges when adapting to a new culture, forming social connections, and accessing reliable information.

To address these issues, the International Student Club was established to:

Provide a platform for communication

Organize cultural exchange activities

Host social events and peer-support programs

Despite these efforts, the club still lacks a centralized online platform to share information, promote events, and connect with both existing and prospective members.

Therefore, our group developed this website to serve as a dedicated space for international students to learn about cultural activities, register as members, and access important information.

🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of the International Student Club website are:

To provide clear and up-to-date information about upcoming cultural events.

To offer a simple and user-friendly registration system for new members.

To promote cultural diversity through festival and cuisine pages.

To support students by answering frequently asked questions (FAQs).
